# Car-Sales-Report

## Overview
This project is about creating a dashboard that shows car sales in the US. We get the sales data from a database [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report/data). We use Python and SQL programming languages for this project. We also use Airflow, which helps us manage the flow of data. First, we fetch the data from PostgreSQL. Then, we clean the data to make sure it's accurate and useful. After that, we upload the data to Elastic Search. Finally, we create the dashboard using a tool Kibana. The dashboard helps us visualize the sales data in a clear and easy-to-understand way.
